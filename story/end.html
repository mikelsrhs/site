  <p>
You see a boat up ahead and there are people searching through the bushes.  You confront them and they are glad to see a survivor.  They say that they are the rescue ship and they are looking for the plane and any survivors.  You tell them you are the only survivor.  They take you back to mainland on a boat while the rest of the crew continues to look for any more survivors.  You are given a blanket, food and water and you finally get a good rest.</p>
